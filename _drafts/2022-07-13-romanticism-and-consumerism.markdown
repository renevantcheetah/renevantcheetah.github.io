Romanticism is a very fascinated word which is as simple as it sounds. In brevity, it means that in order to make the most out of your human potential or to evolve as a person, you must have as many as different experiences as you can. Deal, enduldge and open up to the wide range of the emotions, carry and nurture the different kinds of relationships, taste different cuisines, learn different languages, experience different cultures, read in abudance, carry the notion of an Intellact, drink expensive wine, break free from the daily household chaos, leave behind the default setting, unfold on autopilot, brew secluded coffees, sleep under the moon, travel to Greece, talk to a monkey, behave like one. You got my point right? Omit that last point and you'll be missing out on the fun of the world.

We ought to hear such dialogues on the daily basis by so called Romantic gurus and Influencers fam. Romantic myths about "How travelling to the distant land changed my life" or "Why you should travel to eastern part of the Europe for your honeymoon" are so common that we start making unfounded assumptions about the world based on those myths. The truth is that the world is not as it seems. The world is not as it is. The world is not as it was. The world is not as it will be.

If you find this funny, wait till the Consumerism kicks in..

Consumerism tells us that in order to live your life to the fullest, you must be a radical consumer. Consume as many products and services as possible. If you don't, you'll be left with a life without any meaning. Void, rugged, hollow, in short you are just a body without a soul. If you feel that something is missing in your life, or not quite enough then probably you need to buy more. Buy an another Car, maybe an expensive one, one with paddlle shifters, ticket to that lowfeel concert, take the Yoga classes, buy new clothes even if your closet is buffed. YOU JUST NEED TO BUY FUCKING MORE. That's what the fucking Consumerism is all about.

Romanticism and Consumerism blends perfectly with one another. In fact these two words run together like a pair of two-way streetlights.
These two words are so intertwined that it is so hard to separate them. Everything around us is the byproduct of these two . There are infinite possibilities for us to experience unbelievable emotions and to be in a state of bliss just because we believe it is necessary to do so. But the whole modern tourism and entertainment industry is founded on the very idea of Romanticism and Consumerism. The expensive flights and the critique hotel bedrooms doesn't make any sense until and unless you don't align those experiences with them.

Did you saw any other species like us travelling to the distant lands or buying that expensive pair of sneakers? No, NOBODY has done that ever before like us. A few thousand years ago, you'd never hear anyone even thinking about leaving their house yet alone crossing the border to a distant country or sailing the sea in the search of a new adventure. But then when it all changed?

So why do we need to have lot of different experiences and buy a lot more than we actually need?

Romanticism, which encourages variety, meshes perfectly with consumerism. Their marriage has given birth to the infinite ‘market of
experiences’, on which the modern tourism industry is founded. The
tourism industry does not sell flight tickets and hotel bedrooms. It sells
experiences. Paris is not a city, nor India a country – they are both
experiences, the consumption of which is supposed to widen our
horizons, fulfil our human potential, and make us happier.
Consequently, when the relationship between a millionaire and his wife
is going through a rocky patch, he takes her on an expensive trip to
Paris. The trip is not a reflection of some independent desire, but rather
of an ardent belief in the myths of romantic consumerism. A wealthy
man in ancient Egypt would never have dreamed of solving a
relationship crisis by taking his wife on holiday to Babylon. Instead, he
might have built for her the sumptuous tomb she had always wanted.
