Romanticism is a very fascinated word which is as simple as it sounds. In brevity, it means that in order to make the most out of your human potential or to evolve as a person, you must have as many as unique experiences as you can. Deal, indulged and open up to the wide range of the emotions, carry and nurture different kinds of relationships, taste different cuisines, learn different languages, experience different cultures, read in abundance, carry the notion of an intellect, drink expensive wine, break free from the daily household chaos, leave behind the default setting, unfold on autopilot, brew secluded coffees, sleep under the moon, travel to Greece, talk to a monkey, behave like one.

> You got my point, right? Omit that last point and you’ll be missing out on the fun of the world.

We ought to hear such dialogues on the daily basis by the so-called Romantic gurus and Influencers fam. Romantic myths about “How travelling to the distant land changed my life” or “Why you should travel to the eastern part of the Europe for your honeymoon” are so common that we start making unfounded assumptions about the world based on those myths. However, the reality is far from what it appears to be. The world has never been and will never be exactly as it seems. If you find this funny, wait till the Consumerism kicks in..

Consumerism is a pervasive societal belief that equates material consumption with happiness and fulfillment. It urges us to consume as much as possible, often through messages that suggest that we are inadequate without the latest products and services. The promise of consumerism is seductive: if we buy more, we will feel more alive, more confident, and more successful. Yet, the reality is far from this promise. In fact, consumerism often leads to the opposite outcome. It can leave us feeling empty, overwhelmed, and even spiritually bankrupt. It is all too easy to become lost in a cycle of constant buying, always searching for the next thing to acquire or experience, never truly satisfied or content. The insidious nature of consumerism is that we often disguise it as something else. We are told that buying more will help us fit in, belong, and connect with others. The idea of owning certain products will make us happier, healthier, and more attractive. But in reality, consumerism is a trap. It is a never-ending cycle of consumption that can never be truly fulfilled.

The relationship between Romanticism and Consumerism is so deeply intertwined that they’re like two sides of the same coin. It’s like they were made for each other, complementing and enhancing each other’s strengths in a perfect symbiosis. Watching them in action is like watching a romantic comedy and a shopping spree all at once, where the joy of self-expression and emotional fulfillment are both in full bloom. And just like soda and vodka, they might seem like a strange combination at first, but they’re the ultimate party duo that never disappoints. Romanticism adds the emotional depth and meaning to our lives, while Consumerism adds the material pleasures and aspirations that we crave. Together, they form a dynamic duo that’s always ready to take on the world with unbridled enthusiasm and flair.

Everything around us, from the products we buy to the experiences we seek, is a byproduct of these two powerful forces. In today’s world, there are endless possibilities for us to experience intense emotions and a state of bliss, all in the name of satisfying our desires. Yet, the modern tourism and entertainment industries have taken this to a new level, building their foundations on the very idea of Romanticism and Consumerism. Expensive flights and luxurious hotel rooms make little sense until we align them with these forces and the emotional experiences they offer.

It is not just the material aspects of these industries that are influenced by Romanticism and Consumerism. These two ideologies also shaped the way we perceive and understand beauty, love, and happiness. The idea of a perfect romantic relationship, for example, is often portrayed in media as something that can only be achieved through buying the right products or going on the perfect vacation. However, it is important to remember that Romanticism and Consumerism can also lead to emptiness and disillusionment. The constant pursuit of material goods and experiences can leave us feeling unsatisfied and unfulfilled, as if something is still missing.

Romanticism and consumerism are like the ultimate power couple, and their offspring is the modern tourism industry. It’s not about selling plane tickets and hotel rooms anymore - it’s all about selling experiences, baby! Paris isn’t just a city, it’s a whole vibe, and India isn’t just a country, it’s a life-changing experience that’s supposed to make you a better, happier person. So when a millionaire’s marriage hits a rough patch, he doesn’t just buy his wife a bouquet or a delicate piece of jewey - no, no, no. He takes her on an expensive trip to Paris, because that’s what you do when you believe in the power of romantic consumerism! It’s like a magical potion that will solve all your problems and make you fall in love all over again. And if that doesn’t work, you can always buy her a new car or a diamond ring.

> Have you ever seen a monkey pack its bags and go on a world tour or buy a fancy new pair of sneakers? Or a gorilla taking a flight to Bali for a beach vacation? How about a dolphin swiping its card to book a luxury underwater villa? I’m willing to bet that, like me, you’ve never witnessed any of these things. And why not? Well, it’s because no other species on this planet exhibits the same level of wanderlust and consumerism as we humans do.

A few thousand years ago, the idea of leaving one’s house, let alone crossing the border to a distant country or sailing the sea in search of adventure, was completely unfathomable. But today, we have the means and the desire to explore every corner of the globe and indulge in all the luxuries it has to offer. We’ve taken consumerism and romanticism to a whole new level. That’s because humans have taken consumerism and romanticism to a whole new level. <u>We’re not satisfied with just surviving and reproducing like our primate cousins, SEX WITHOUT A CONDOM, nehhh we want to experience everything the world has to offer, and we want to do it in style.</u> It’s like we’re on a constant quest for the next big thing, the next thrill, the next dopamine hit. And let’s be real. Sometimes it feels like we’re all just Harvey Specter on steroids, chasing after the almighty dollar and the perfect Instagram moment. But it’s the world we live in now - where romanticism meets consumerism, and anything is possible with the swipe of a credit card.

And just for the record, ladies and gentlemen, I am about to make a bold move in a few years and buy myself an Aston Martin DBS and Ferrari Roma! And before you start pointing your fingers, let me tell you this - just because I’m indulging in some consumerism doesn’t mean I’m not a man of culture.

So, excuse me for a moment while I chase my dream cars. Please don’t poke this article with a stick and throw it in my face in the future, saying that I’m contradicting myself by promoting both Romanticism and Consumerism. Well, Maybe I am contradicting but who’s saying that a love of sleek cars with a powerful engine and luxurious design isn’t a form of culture on its own.           3.9liter, V8 twin turbocharged, whopping 612 horsepower and 561 lb-ft of raw torque. Fuck consumerism.
