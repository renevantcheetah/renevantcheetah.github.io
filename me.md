“Right, I’d just like to start by laying down a couple of rules. Firstly, if you do have a mobile phone or any gadget… please, leave it switched on; keep yourselves entertained. And secondly, if anyone texts you any good jokes, could you please forward them to me?” Just in case if you want, otherwise you may subscribe to my mailing list. Ok now let's do some talking.

​
Hi, I am Vipul Maheshwari. I grew up in the small town of Deogarh which is located nearby Udaipur in Rajasthan. I try to make things simpler and clearer because I am not so much into the rotting techniques. I am currently in my Sophomore year of Engineering with a major in Computer Science. I love playing Badminton and I also did win some trophies in my middle school for various orating competitions.

I Love F.R.I.E.N.D.S, Game of Thrones, Cosmos, Designated survivor, and OUR PLANET, and If you don't know what all these are then don't worry because I love जेठालाल too.

That about wraps it up for me. If you made it this far, I appreciate you being here. Peace out.

आवजो!
