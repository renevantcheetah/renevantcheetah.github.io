Romanticism tells us that in order to make the most of our human potential we must have as many different experiences as we can. We must deal, enduldge and open up to the wide range of the emotions, carry and nurture the different kinds of relationships, taste different cuisines, learn different languages, and experience different cultures. So theoretically, we can think of the Romanticism as a way of making the most of our human potential.
