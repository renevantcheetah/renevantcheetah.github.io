Open the doors to the future and you will find most of the teenagers and adults are wasting a hell lot of time endulging in pretty useless things. Fasten your seat belts people because this is going to be a daunting one and trust me you will not like it.

Open your YouTube and type "Vlog" on the search bar. Play any of the video from recommendation, watch it from the point blank to the end and come back to this post. I will wait.

You did it? Good. Now, I want you to think about the following questions:

1. What did you learn from that video?
2. What's the purpose of that video?
3. What's the purpose of that channel?

Think about that for a moment. I have a good feeling that you will simply nod and reply, "I don't know." A random couple was entertaining guests at their house while serving them a delicious Indian breakfast and chatting with them about various aspects of their lives. What about a random guy posting on the internet that his wife is pregnant and that he will soon become a father? Or perhaps for the better part there was a guy posting a video about how he bought his new Scooty and visited his favourite destination with his brother. You didn't learn anything useful from those videos, did you? No, Right! Well, I am not surprised. I mean, I didn't either. Who does right? But the combined views of those videos are in millions, Millions of people are watching those sterile, barren and worthless videos day in day out without even realizing that they are wasting their time and potential.

> What the Fuck man? Why do you care dude, let them do whatever they want. It's their life.

Let's forget everything for now and focus on only two words for now, Information and Knowledge. Somehow both of them overlaps one another but there is a minuscule silver lining between them. To make it simple for you, Information is everything you see, posses and indulge in, but on the other hand Knowledge is deeply integrated within your mental ecosystem. You need to put a substantial amount of time to gather Knowledge sometimes a lifetime but Information is just a click away. You can get it from anywhere and everywhere.

Simple, Cool, got it. Easy pissy.

Now for the next part, let's talk about the most important thing in the world, Time. Time is the most precious thing in the world, you can't get it back once it's gone. You can't buy it, you can't sell it, you can't even steal it. It's just there, ticking away. Tick-Tock, Tick-Tock.

Unapogetically, I feel pity, sorrow and condolence for all of them who thinks like this. The disparity and severeness of this is highly profound and it just give me goosebumps to think that this imbalance or inconsistency of the online world as it might be even larger than the the real physical world that we live in. Internet is very cheap now days, almost everyone has access to it's immense amount of power but not all has an equal understadning of how to use that gem in adequate amount. Some of us are living in an info-apocalypse world waiting for the time when this turns into the holocaust. If we don't take it seriosly, and teach the adverse effects of this to our loved ones, we will be the ones who will be responsible for the downfall of the next generation. I fear if this persists for the longer period of time, in no time our society will become pathetic and paralyzed.

So for

Ok for the sake of storytelling, let's assume a simple scenario. Sundar Pichai, CEO Of Alphabet inc. and Google opens up his YouTube and start watching a video of a vlogger who went to some random city and try an exquisite cuisine of some random cafe. Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, opens up Twitter and start reading a tweet of a random person who is talking about how he is going to buy a new car.

"The important, empowering thing to realize, as you structure a piece, is that you are the director. You control the narrative—not the other way around. You can introduce characters or settings at will, when you need them. I know this sounds almost silly, or at least obvious, but it’s something you really have to embrace and believe. It’s a state of mind. You have to relish the power of being the storyteller who calls in material as you need to make your point.

I’m always preaching the importance of confidence in writing, and this is another example of where it’s the essential ingredient. If you abandon the idea of how your story should unfold and tell it how it organically arises in your mind, you will begin finding the structure that’s authentic and natural."
