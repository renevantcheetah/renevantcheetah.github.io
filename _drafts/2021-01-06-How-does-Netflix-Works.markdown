Not recently till the previous decade, Netflix actually rent DVDs to the viewers as the generalized concept, and just when you thought it’s a joke, FYI there are still some Netflix users probably in the number of millions who still pay this streaming giant for renting the DVDs. Yeah, I know there are still some OLD SCHOOL fellas.

From opening a new account to sharing your girlfriend’s password. From watching an episode of     F.R.I.E.N.D.S to binge Peaky Blinders, a lot is going on..

Netflix accounts for 23 % of all the traffic generated on the internet, whoosh... that's a lot of traffic.

Watching so much high-definition video content over the internet requires a considerable amount of infrastructure and setup, probably this is the main hindrance to the company at the initial time of 2007  when the streaming services are provided to the broadband users only. But the introduction of high-speed internet changed the whole entertainment industry profoundly and today the Netflix consumes a total of 15% of total internet bandwidth.

Netflix users spend around 1 billion hours per week on its streaming content which when divided into 149 million users gives a rationalized figure of 6.78 hours per week per individual. That's approximately 1 hour of daily streaming each day. So How exactly Netflix manages to remain at this peak position in the entertainment market even with the presence of so many other OTT (Over-the-top service) platforms, let's find out.

## ***Netflix Technological Workflow***

Netflix works on the [Microservice architecture](https://medium.com/hashmapinc/the-what-why-and-how-of-a-microservices-architecture-4179579423a9). To understand it better let's think of an orchestra where every other musician is playing his individual instrument to make a whole piece of a symphony, just in the same way every service you can think of on Netflix whether it's for creating a new account or to pay for the subscription, every individual service on the Netflix is running on its own without interfering with the other one. BUT IF THEY ALL ARE RUNNING ON THEIR OWN THEN HOW ALL ARE THEY COORDINATING?
